# Cead Consent Manager

Cead is a cookie and tracking consent manager that is extremely simple and lightweight. It is designed to help websites implement a simple Accept or Deny dialog that will actually enable or disable tracking.

Many websites implement a notice that doesn't allow opt-out, some offer an option that does nothing, whilst others only offer an opt-out solution - conveniently after they've collected all of your data.
Caed helps you fix this, allowing you to meet your privacy obligations with little effort or code. In opt-in mode, tracking scripts won't even run until consent is given. In opt-out mode withdrawing consent will clear tracking cookies entirely.

Cead is primarily created in response an increase in unsolicited web surveillance, but also to assist with meeting the standards of regulation including the EU GDPR &amp; ePrivacy and California's CCPA. As privacy legislation becomes more strict it's important that solutions offer compliant opt-in and opt-out controls which Cead offers at it's core.

*Note:* I am not a lawyer, and Cead isn't a magic fix for privacy compliance. When implemented correctly it meets commonly-understood privacy standards, but you may need legal advice for your specific usecase.

## Features

- *Simple* — Most sites don't need a fancy system with different purposes, just a simple opt-in/opt-out that can be used for all tracking and cookies;
- *Lightweight* — Weighs in at just xxxkB minified and xxxkB gzip;
- *Flexible* — HTML is provided by you so all text and classes are fully configurable, with lots of options on attributes, cookie name and mode in the JavaScript;
- *Standalone* — Entirely self-contained, Cead doesn't link with any complex external system or have hundreds of dependencies;
- *Open Source* — Free to use, modify and extend as you'd like! Licensed under the permissive Apache-2.0 license.
